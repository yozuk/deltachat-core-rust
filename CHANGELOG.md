## 1.57.0

### API Changes

- breaking change: removed deaddrop chat #2514 #2563

  Contact request chats are not merged into a single virtual
  "deaddrop" chat anymore. Instead, they are shown in the chatlist the
  same way as other chats, but sending of messages to them is not
  allowed and MDNs are not sent automatically until the chat is
  "accepted" by the user.

  New API:
  - `dc_chat_is_contact_request()`: returns true if chat is a contact
    request.  In this case an option to accept the chat via
    `dc_accept_chat()` should be shown in the UI.
  - `dc_accept_chat()`: unblock the chat or accept contact request
  - `dc_block_chat()`: block the chat, currently works only for mailing
    lists.

  Removed API:
  - `dc_create_chat_by_msg_id()`: deprecated 2021-02-07 in favor of
    `dc_decide_on_contact_request()`
  - `dc_marknoticed_contact()`: deprecated 2021-02-07 in favor of
    `dc_decide_on_contact_request()`
  - `dc_decide_on_contact_request()`: this call requires a message ID
    from deaddrop chat as input. As deaddrop chat is removed, this
    call can't be used anymore.
  - `dc_msg_get_real_chat_id()`: use `dc_msg_get_chat_id()` instead, the
    only difference between these calls was in handling of deaddrop
    chat
  - removed `DC_CHAT_ID_DEADDROP` and `DC_STR_DEADDROP` constants

- breaking change: removed `DC_EVENT_ERROR_NETWORK` and `DC_STR_SERVER_RESPONSE`
  Instead, there is a new api `dc_get_connectivity()`
  and `dc_get_connectivity_html()`;
  `DC_EVENT_CONNECTIVITY_CHANGED` is emitted on changes

- breaking change: removed `dc_accounts_import_account()`
  Instead you need to add an account and call `dc_imex(DC_IMEX_IMPORT_BACKUP)`
  on its context

- update account api, 2 new methods:
  `int dc_all_work_done (dc_context_t* context);`
  `int dc_accounts_all_work_done (dc_accounts_t* accounts);`

- add api to check if a message was `Auto-Submitted`
  cffi: `int dc_msg_is_bot (const dc_msg_t* msg);`
  python: `Message.is_bot()`

- `dc_context_t* dc_accounts_get_selected_account (dc_accounts_t* accounts);`
  now returns `NULL` if there is no selected account

- added `dc_accounts_maybe_network_lost()` for systems core cannot find out
  connectivity loss on its own (eg. iOS) #2550

### Added

- alleviate login problems with providers which only
  support RSA1024 keys by switching back from Rustls 
  to native-tls, by using the new async-email/async-native-tls 
  crate from @dignifiedquire. thanks @link2xt. 

- introduce per-contact profile images to send out 
  own profile image heuristically, and fix sending
  out of profile images in "in-prepare" groups. 
  this also extends the Chat-spec that is maintained
  in core to specify Chat-Group-Image and Chat-Group-Avatar
  headers. thanks @r10s and @hpk42.

- fix merging of protected headers from the encrypted
  to the unencrypted parts, now not happening recursively
  anymore.  thanks @hpk and @r10s

- fix/optimize autocrypt gossip headers to only get 
  sent when there are more than 2 people in a chat. 
  thanks @link2xt

- fix displayname to use the authenticated name 
  when available (displayname as coming from contacts 
  themselves). thanks @simon-laux

- introduce preliminary support for offline autoconfig 
  for nauta provider. thanks @hpk42 @r10s

## 1.0.0-beta.15

- fix #994 attachment appeared doubled in chats (and where actually
  downloaded after smtp-send). @hpk42

## 1.0.0-beta.14

- fix packaging issue with our rust-email fork, now we are tracking
  master again there. hpk42

## 1.0.0-beta.13

- fix #976 -- unicode-issues in display-name of email addresses. @hpk42

- fix #985 group add/remove member bugs resulting in broken groups.  @hpk42

- fix hanging IMAP connections -- we now detect with a 15second timeout
  if we cannot terminate the IDLE IMAP protocol. @hpk42 @link2xt

- fix incoming multipart/mixed containing html, to show up as
  attachments again.  Fixes usage for simplebot which sends html
  files for users to interact with the bot. @adbenitez @hpk42 

- refinements to internal autocrypt-handling code, do not send
  prefer-encrypt=nopreference as it is the default if no attribute
  is present.  @linkxt 

- simplify, modularize and rustify several parts 
  of dc-core (general WIP). @link2xt @flub @hpk42 @r10s

- use async-email/async-smtp to handle SMTP connections, might
  fix connection/reconnection issues. @link2xt 

- more tests and refinements for dealing with blobstorage @flub @hpk42 

- use a dedicated build-server for CI testing of core PRs


## 1.0.0-beta.12

- fix python bindings to use core for copying attachments to blobdir
  and fix core to actually do it. @hpk42

## 1.0.0-beta.11

- trigger reconnect more often on imap error states.  Should fix an 
  issue observed when trying to empty a folder.  @hpk42

- un-split qr tests: we fixed qr-securejoin protocol flakyness 
  last weeks. @hpk42

## 1.0.0-beta.10

- fix grpid-determination from in-reply-to and references headers. @hpk42

- only send Autocrypt-gossip headers on encrypted messages. @dignifiedquire

- fix reply-to-encrypted message to also be encrypted. @hpk42

- remove last unsafe code from dc_receive_imf :) @hpk42

- add experimental new dc_chat_get_info_json FFI/API so that desktop devs
  can play with using it. @jikstra

- fix encoding of subjects and attachment-filenames @hpk42
  @dignifiedquire . 

## 1.0.0-beta.9

- historic: we now use the mailparse crate and lettre-email to generate mime
  messages.  This got rid of mmime completely, the C2rust generated port of the libetpan 
  mime-parse -- IOW 22KLocs of cumbersome code removed! see 
  https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/pull/904#issuecomment-561163330
  many thanks @dignifiedquire for making everybody's life easier 
  and @jonhoo (from rust-imap fame) for suggesting to use the mailparse crate :) 

- lots of improvements and better error handling in many rust modules 
  thanks @link2xt @flub @r10s, @hpk42 and @dignifiedquire 

- @r10s introduced a new device chat which has an initial
  welcome message.  See 
  https://c.delta.chat/classdc__context__t.html#a1a2aad98bd23c1d21ee42374e241f389
  for the main new FFI-API.

- fix moving self-sent messages, thanks @r10s, @flub, @hpk42

- fix flakyness/sometimes-failing verified/join-protocols, 
  thanks @flub, @r10s, @hpk42

- fix reply-to-encrypted message to keep encryption 

- new DC_EVENT_SECUREJOIN_MEMBER_ADDED event 

- many little fixes and rustifications (@link2xt, @flub, @hpk42)


## 1.0.0-beta.8

- now uses async-email/async-imap as the new base 
  which makes imap-idle interruptible and thus fixes
  several issues around the imap thread being in zombie state . 
  thanks @dignifiedquire, @hpk42 and @link2xt. 

- fixes imap-protocol parsing bugs that lead to infinitely
  repeated crashing while trying to receive messages with
  a subjec that contained non-utf8. thanks @link2xt

- fixed logic to find encryption subkey -- previously 
  delta chat would use the primary key for encryption
  (which works with RSA but not ECC). thanks @link2xt

- introduce a new device chat where core and UIs can 
  add "device" messages.  Android uses it for an initial
  welcome message. thanks @r10s

- fix time smearing (when two message are virtually send
  in the same second, there would be misbehaviour because
  we didn't persist smeared time). thanks @r10s

- fix double-dotted extensions like .html.zip or .tar.gz  
  to not mangle them when creating blobfiles.  thanks @flub

- fix backup/exports where the wrong sql file would be modified,
  leading to problems when exporting twice.  thanks @hpk42

- several other little fixes and improvements

## 1.0.0-beta.1 

- first beta of the Delta Chat Rust core library. many fixes of crashes
  and other issues compared to 1.0.0-alpha.5.

- Most code is now "rustified" and does not do manual memory allocation anymore. 

- The `DC_EVENT_GET_STRING` event is not used anymore, removing the last
  event where the core requested a return value from the event callback. 

  Please now use `dc_set_stock_translation()` API for core messages
  to be properly localized. 

- Deltachat FFI docs are automatically generated and available here: 
  https://c.delta.chat 

- New events ImapMessageMoved and ImapMessageDeleted
